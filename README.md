# 🏃‍♂️ Predicting Gait Movement with Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
**Implementation of Supervised Learning on a Regression Task** is a machine learning-based analysis of **Multivariate Gait Data**, a six-dimensional dataset collected from **10 subjects** under **3 different conditions** (*normal, knee-braced, ankle-braced*) while walking on a treadmill. The dataset includes **joint angle measurements across 101 normalized time points**, making it ideal for studying human motion and biomechanics.

## 🎯 Project Summary

### 🔍 Objective
- Develop a **regression model** to analyze gait patterns and predict **joint angles** under different conditions.

### 📊 Dataset
- **Multivariate Gait Data** with six key dimensions:
  - **Subject ID**
  - **Gait cycle repetitions**
  - **Leg side** (left/right)
  - **Joint type** (ankle, knee, etc.)
  - **Condition** (normal, knee-braced, ankle-braced)
  - **Normalized time points** (101 steps per gait cycle)

### ⚙️ Preprocessing
- **Data cleaning, normalization, and structuring** to ensure meaningful analysis.

### 🤖 Model Implementation
- Applied **supervised learning regression techniques**, including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Neural Networks** (optional)

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics

  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score**

### 🔬 Results & Findings
- Successfully captured **gait variations** under different conditions.
- Provided insights into **how bracing affects joint movement during walking**.
