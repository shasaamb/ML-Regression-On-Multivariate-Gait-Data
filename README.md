Project Summary
Objective: Develop a regression model to analyze gait patterns and predict joint angles based on specific conditions.
Dataset: Multivariate Gait Data with six dimensions, including subject ID, gait cycle repetitions, leg side, joint type, and normalized time points.
Preprocessing: The data was cleaned, normalized, and structured to extract meaningful patterns.
Model Used: Implementation of supervised learning regression techniques, likely including models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks to predict joint angles.
Evaluation Metrics: The model’s performance was assessed using standard regression evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.
Results & Findings: The trained model successfully captured gait variations under different conditions, providing insights into how bracing affects joint movement during walking.
